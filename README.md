# Transvision

Transvision is a Web application targetting the Mozilla localization community created and maintained by the French Mozilla community (http://www.mozfr.org).

The main purpose of Transvision is to be provide a specialized search engine to find localized strings in Mozilla code repositories for all Mozilla products (Firefox, Thunderbird, Firefox OS, Seamonkeyâ€¦) and websites (currenty only www.mozilla.org is supported) via a Web interface. There are also side-features such as checks for common typographical errors for some languages, checks for the validity of localized access keys in the UI or comparison views between Mozilla repository channels (Nightly/Aurora/Beta/Release).

Transvision is written in PHP, the string extraction is done with the Silme library (Python) and server install/maintenance scripts are in Bash.

Transvision was created by Philippe Dessante, from the FrenchMozilla localization team.

Lead developer since version 1.0 : Pascal Chevrel (pascal AT mozilla DOT com).
